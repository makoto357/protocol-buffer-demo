# What are Protocol Buffers?
- Protocol buffers are the most commonly used data format at Google.
- Protocol Buffers are a language-neutral, platform-neutral extensible mechanism for serializing structured data.
- A combination of the definition language (created in .proto files).
- The code that the proto compiler generates to interface with data, language-specific runtime libraries.
- The serialization format for typed, structured data that is written to a file.
